# VSCUnity
Unity3D editor plugin to make Unity projects Visual Studio Code compatible and add Unity/shader syntax highlighting.

Add to /Assets/Editor/VCSUnity and then choose "Update project for Visual Studio Code" from the "VS Code" menu.

Choose "Add Unity symbol highlighting to Visual Studio Code" to update Visual Studio Code's C# syntax highlighting with all Unity specific types.

Choose "Add Unity shader plugin to Visual Studio Code" to add Unity .shader syntax support to Visual Studio Code. (Make sure you copy the /VSCUnity folder to your Unity project's root folder first as the script expects it to be in that location when installing).


Prompted from @prime_31's note that Xamerin projects open correctly in Visual Studio Code and my general desire to nuke MonoDevelop from orbit.
